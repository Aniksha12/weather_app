# weather_app
This project shows us the weather of any city present in the globe, just enter the name of your/any city from around the world to get the current weather conditions together with 5 day forecast.
I have used HTML for basuc structures, Css for some txt, image formatting and made this responsive and attractive using CSS and its elements.Also uused javascript for making my website behave or work as i wanted, and linked the weather API which tells us the weather.
